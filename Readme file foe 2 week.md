# ♻️ Garbage Classification using Deep Learning  
**AICTE – Shell Green AI Internship (Week 2 Task)**  

## 📅 Week 2: Model Building & Training  
This repository contains the second milestone of the Green AI Internship project. In this phase, we implemented a deep learning pipeline using **Transfer Learning** to classify images of garbage into six categories. This contributes to sustainable waste management using AI.

## 🧠 Model Overview

To leverage the power of pre-trained models while reducing training time and computational cost, **Transfer Learning** was applied using **MobileNetV2** as the base architecture.

### ⚙️ Tools & Frameworks
- Python 3.x  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Google Colab (recommended for GPU access)

## 🏗️ Key Implementation Steps

### 1. **Import Libraries & Load Preprocessed Data**
The dataset from Week 1 (after resizing, normalization, and augmentation) was loaded using `ImageDataGenerator`.

```python
train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(...)
validation_generator = val_datagen.flow_from_directory(...)
````

### 2. **Base Model: MobileNetV2**

* Pre-trained on **ImageNet**
* Top layers excluded (`include_top=False`)
* `input_shape=(224, 224, 3)`
* Frozen base layers for initial training phase

```python
base_model = tf.keras.applications.MobileNetV2(input_shape=(224, 224, 3), include_top=False, weights='imagenet')
base_model.trainable = False
```

### 3. **Custom Head**

A custom classification head was added with:

* GlobalAveragePooling2D
* Dense layers with ReLU activation
* Final softmax layer for 6 output classes

### 4. **Compilation & Training**

* Optimizer: `Adam`
* Loss: `categorical_crossentropy`
* Metrics: `accuracy`

```python
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

* Training ran for 10 epochs (adjustable) with validation monitoring.

### 5. **Performance Metrics & Visualization**

Training/validation accuracy and loss were plotted using `matplotlib`.

```python
plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'], label='Train Accuracy')
plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'], label='Validation Accuracy')
```

## 📈 Results

The model achieved **\[Insert Accuracy]%** accuracy on the validation set after training for 10 epochs. (Update this based on your actual results/logs)

---

## 🔁 Optional: Fine-Tuning

To further boost performance:

* Unfreeze top layers of `base_model`
* Re-compile with a **lower learning rate**
* Continue training for a few more epochs

---

## ✅ Next Steps

🔜 **Week 3:** Evaluation & Deployment

* Evaluate using test data
* Generate confusion matrix and classification report
* Explore exporting the model (`.h5`, `.tflite`)
* Optional: Build a demo web app or integrate with edge devices

✅ If you’d like, I can extract actual training accuracy/loss from the notebook and plug them in directly. Want me to do that?
